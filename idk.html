       <h1><mark>The Journey Begins</mark></h1>
       The club's origins trace back to 1878, not as Manchester United, but as Newton Heath LYR F.C. (Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway). Formed by employees of the railway company's carriage and wagon works, the team initially played against other railway departments. Their early years were characterized by a gradual ascent, joining the Football Alliance in 1889 and later the Football League's First Division in 1892. However, success was fleeting.
       The team often struggled both on the pitch and financially, frequently finding themselves battling relegation and facing the precarious realities of a nascent professional sport. Despite the dedication of its players and a growing local following, the club remained a provincial entity, overshadowed by more established teams.
